## Description

The A + B problem is the most basic problem in competitive programming, and is often used as a sanity check in contests. Let's try to solve it with some x86_64 shellcode.

Given two integers a and b, find the value of a + b.

### Input Format

a is placed in rdi and b is placed in rsi when calling your function.

### Output Format

Place the answer in rax and return.

### Constraints

0 <= a, b <= 10^18
